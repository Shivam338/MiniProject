# Requirements
## Introduction
 The Project is the implementation of a Simple Calendar. 
 
## Feature
The only feature here implemented is that it shows the dates the for any given year in a tabular form as shown in a real calendar.
It does not stops here, for the future versions there would be features such as:
--> Adding an Event
--> Removing an Event
--> Reminders and much more<br/>

## Swot Analysis:
##Strengths
1. Everyone is familiar with a Calendar, so it makes it perfectly natural for a person to get his things organized for better time management.<br/>
2. Many religions depend on the uninterrupted seven-day week, so a calendar makes the days easier to remember and is a go-to for Festivals and Holidays.<br/>
3. Has a huge user base, concluding it will never be out-dated.

##Weakness
1. Needs alot of work and updates to make it desirable to a user.
2. Calendars are boring to look to as they only display dates, weeks and months.( Nothing Dynamic )
3. No events add-ons and reminders currently.

##Opportunities
1. Can add various features such as dynamic color changes depending on the season or the month of the Year.
2. Can add small animations to make it look better and fun.
3. The priorities will be given to Event add-ons, editing and deleting an event, and last but not least Reminders.

##Threats
1. Fast moving and creative apps are big time threats to a simple staic calender.
